	abstract = {Classification between first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and healthy controls is of particular interest to the study of schizophrenia. However, predicting psychosis with cognitive assessments alone is prone to human errors and often lacks biological evidence to back up the findings. In this work, we combined a multimodal dataset of structural MRI and cognitive data to disentangle the detection of first-episode psychosis with a machine learning approach. For this purpose, we proposed a robust detection pipeline that explores the variables in high-order feature space. We applied the pipeline to Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset with 108 participants in EP and 47 controls. The pipeline demonstrated strong performance with 74.67\% balanced accuracy on this task. Further feature analysis shows that the model is capable of identifying verified causative biological factors for the occurrence of psychosis based on volumetric MRI measurements, which suggests the potential of data-driven approaches for the search for neuroimaging biomarkers in future studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study did not receive any funding.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The study used ONLY openly available human data that were originally located at the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA) under the Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/human-connectome-project-for-early-psychosis.I confirm that all necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived, and that any patient/participant/sample identifiers included were not known to anyone (e.g., hospital staff, patients or participants themselves) outside the research group so cannot be used to identify individuals.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov. I confirm that any such study reported in the manuscript has been registered and the trial registration ID is provided (note: if posting a prospective study registered retrospectively, please provide a statement in the trial ID field explaining why the study was not registered in advance).Yes I have followed all appropriate research reporting guidelines, such as any relevant EQUATOR Network research reporting checklist(s) and other pertinent material, if applicable.YesAll data produced in the present study are available upon reasonable request to the authors.https://github.com/Catherine9811/HCP-EP-Codebase},
