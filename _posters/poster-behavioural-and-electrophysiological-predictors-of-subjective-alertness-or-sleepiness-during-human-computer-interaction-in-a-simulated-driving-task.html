title: "Behavioural and Electrophysiological Predictors of Subjective Alertness/Sleepiness during Human-Computer Interaction in a Simulated Driving Task"
excerpt: "This study investigates the relationship between subjective and objective measures of alertness and sleepiness during human-computer interaction in a simulated driving task. Using EEG, PVT, and PERCLOS data from 21 participants, we demonstrate that EEG alpha power at frontal sites is the strongest single predictor of self-reported alertness, with multimodal measures offering improved prediction. These findings support the integration of physiological and behavioural metrics for continuous, reliable monitoring of user alertness beyond discrete subjective assessments.<br/><br/><img src='/images/poster-alertness-driving.jpg' width='70%'>"

Abstract
</h2>
Assessing the alertness/sleepiness fluctuation of computer users is critical for ensuring safety, efficiency, and satisfaction during human-computer interaction. In this study, we evaluated the correlation of various alertness/sleepiness measurements in a software-simulated driving task. The 60-minute-long experiment was conducted for 21 participants using a 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system with on-screen Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and subjective sleepiness measurement via the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) every five minutes. Spectral power bands and percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS) were further extracted from the collected EEG time series. We demonstrated a strong positive association between subjective alertness/sleepiness measurement from KSS as the outcome variable and objective measurements as predictors in the preceding 5-minute window, including physiological measurements from multiple EEG power bands with clustered electrodes, performance measurements from PVT, and ocular measurements from PERCLOS. 
Among all objective measures, we found that EEG alpha band power at the frontal cluster serves as the best single predictor of self-reported alertness/sleepiness score, while other measurements are also significantly correlated with subjective alertness/sleepiness. We further demonstrate that combining multiple objective measurements provides a more reliable prediction of computer user's alertness/sleepiness. The significant association of objective measures extends the standardization of subjective scales beyond the moments of subjective assessments, offering broader temporal resolution in alertness/sleepiness measurements.
