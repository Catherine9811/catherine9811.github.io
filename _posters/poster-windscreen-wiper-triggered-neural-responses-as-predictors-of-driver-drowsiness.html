title: "Windscreen Wiper Triggered Neural Responses as Predictors of Driver Drowsiness"
excerpt: "This study investigates whether windscreen wipers can elicit steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) during simulated driving. EEG data from 21 participants revealed asymmetric parieto-occipital responses aligned with wiper motion, with frequency-domain analysis showing significant differences in spectral power and SNR across wiper conditions.

Abstract
</h2>
Neural responses elicited by repetitive visual stimuli, known as steady-state visual
evoked potentials (SSVEP), have gained attention due to their stability and relative
immunity to artifacts, regardless of the attentive state of the participants. In this study, we explored the effect of windscreen wipers as visual stimulation for
inducing SSVEP signals, measured by electroencephalogram (EEG). 21 participants
were driving in a simulated driving environment during three separate sessions with
a regular wiper, an irregular wiper and no wiper. Despite the slow frequency of the
wiper movements, we observed a significant asymmetrical neural response in parieto-
occipital regions (PO7, PO8), revealing consistent oscillation patterns coinciding with
the wiper's moving direction. Frequency-domain analysis with frequency-tagging using
Welch's method of Fast Fourier Transform highlighted significant difference in power
spectral density and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between regular wiper and no wiper
conditions. The effect of brain oscillation entrainment effect on EEG Delta band serves
as a significant mediator for drowsiness outcome affected by the wiper conditions. We
also discovered a significant negative correlation between SNR triggered by wiper move-
ments and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, suggesting that neural responses decrease
as drowsiness increases which extended the scope of previous study. These find-
ings indicated that wiper-induced low-frequency neural signals could serve as a reliable,
non-invasive measure for brain oscillation entrainment in parieto-occipital regions and
could be used as a biomarker for driver drowsiness detection.
