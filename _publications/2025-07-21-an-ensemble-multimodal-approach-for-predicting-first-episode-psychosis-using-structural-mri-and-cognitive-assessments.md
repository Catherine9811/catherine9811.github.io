excerpt: 'This study presents a machine learning approach for detecting first-episode psychosis (FEP) by combining structural MRI and cognitive data. Applied to the HCP-EP dataset, the proposed multimodal pipeline achieved 74.67% balanced accuracy and identified biologically relevant MRI features, highlighting the potential of data-driven methods in advancing neuroimaging-based psychosis research.'

Abstract:

Classification between first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and healthy controls is of particular interest to the study of schizophrenia. However, predicting psychosis with cognitive assessments alone is prone to human errors and often lacks biological evidence to back up the findings. In this work, we combined a multimodal dataset of structural MRI and cognitive data to disentangle the detection of first-episode psychosis with a machine learning approach. For this purpose, we proposed a robust detection pipeline that explores the variables in high-order feature space. We applied the pipeline to Human Connectome Project for Early Psychosis (HCP-EP) dataset with 108 participants in EP and 47 controls. The pipeline demonstrated strong performance with 74.67% balanced accuracy on this task. Further feature analysis shows that the model is capable of identifying verified causative biological factors for the occurrence of psychosis based on volumetric MRI measurements, which suggests the potential of data-driven approaches for the search for neuroimaging biomarkers in future studies.
