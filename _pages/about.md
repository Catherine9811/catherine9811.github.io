Welcome to my personal webpage!

About my studies
======
I am interested in studying how alertness and mental fatigue vary during human-computer interaction, drawing on methods from cognitive neuroscience and machine learning. My research aims to better understand how changes in attention and fatigue influence our interaction with computers, and how this knowledge might inform the design of more responsive and supportive systems.
